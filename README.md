# Traffic Signs Recognition System

A traffic sign recognition system using Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Tkinter GUI interface.

## Abstract

This project focuses on improving road safety by creating a system that can recognize and classify traffic signs. The main goal is to help drivers follow traffic rules and avoid accidents by identifying signs in real-time. To achieve this, a deep learning model was built using Keras, a popular deep learning framework. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and was trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The results showed high accuracy (95.2% on test set) in recognizing different types of signs, even in challenging conditions. This success suggests that the system could be used in real-life situations, such as in a car app that uses a dashcam to detect signs and give drivers instant warnings and directions.

```bash
python GUI.py
```

### Train Model from Scratch
```bash
python traffic_signs.py
```

## GUI User Guide

1. **üöó Select vehicle type**: Choose "Car" or "Motorbike" to see corresponding fines according to Vietnamese law
